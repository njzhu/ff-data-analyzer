Title: Fantasy Football Start/Sit Analyzer


This project is an analytical tool meant to help fantasy football players decide between two players to start in their matchup. Using basic linear regression along with expert predictions, this tool will help fantasy players decide who to start in situations when both seem like viable options. In addition, this tool also allows for users to compare two full teams to see who will win a given matchup. Lastly, a user is able to see an expertâ€™s prediction over the course of 5 years in 5 different positions to analyze expert accuracy.
